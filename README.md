# Replacement planning

This repository includes code and datasets on replacement planning projects.


## About
Replacement planning consists in addressing short-term lack of resources in organizations, due to temporary or permanent unavailability of employees or machines. Although aimed at tactical decisions more than at long-term strategic planning, a replacement system is critical to guarantee continuity of operations in business processes. As such, a variety of aspects must be considered, e.g. capabilities of resources, their workloads and possible other domain-specific constraints. 

We propose a framework for supporting resource replacement that makes use of logs of past process executions to model a social network of resources through organizational mining techniques. The social graph extends traditional approaches by modelling a richer relation of handover of work. On this top, a similarity measure among resources is exploited along with run-time resource workload to define an Integer Linear Model to determine the optimal assignment of the unavailable resource's tasks to the available ones.


## Content

The folder "code" includes an Eclipse project implementing the resource replacement approach described in [1].
